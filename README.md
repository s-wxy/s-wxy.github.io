Sweet 16
========
[Wordpress 2016 theme][2016] revives in Jekyll.

This theme is for those who like the visual design of Wordpress but otherwise
want a static site.

This theme is a reaction to content injection vulnerability in Wordpress 4.7.
I've always liked the design of Wordpress default themes.  Wordpress is also
good for muggles but too complex for me.  I've never thought that such
complexity would cause problem until a random French guy injected a spam
article.

Customization
-------------
Customization is welcome since developers' and writers' files are somewhat
separated.  The only underscored paths writers touch are `_data` and `_posts`.

Differences from [2016, the reference theme][2016] are considered bugs although
some of them are impossible to fix due to the nature of Jekyll.  Bravely file
bugs or make pull requests to make this theme more close to the reference
theme.

License
-------
GPL because this theme is a derivative from Wordpress.
