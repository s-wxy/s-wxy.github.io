[Wbridge5][wbr5] is a prominent bridge program.  Wbridge5 has been [world
champion of the bridge programs][champ] in 2005, 2007, 2008, and 2016â€“2018.
Besides excellent playing, this program also employs a dedicated bidding
system.  I dream of human pairs using a bidding system like Wbridge5, so I
collate the bidding system in this book.

The topic of this book is mainly bidding because playing is somewhat universal.
Playing depends not on how to bid but on meaning of every call.  There are so
many experts and books for playing that writing one more book is infeasible for
me.

Wbridge5 has a 2/1 bidding system with French flavors, as it originates from
France.  It incorporates some French conventions which improve bidding
structure from Standard American.  Others French conventions are not included
in Wbridge5.
