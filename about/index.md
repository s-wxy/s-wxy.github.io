Hello! I am a 2nd year Ph.D student in <a rel="mjiang" href="http://www.meng-jiang.com/">Dr.Meng Jiang</a>'s <a rel="dm2" href="http://www.meng-jiang.com/lab.html">Data Mining towards Decision Making (DM2) Lab</a> at <a rel="ndcse" href="http://cse.nd.edu/">CSE@Notre Dame</a>. I am currently serving as professional development chair in <a rel="ndswe" href="https://engineering.nd.edu/student-organizations/swe/gradswe">Notre Dame grad-Society of Women Engineers</a>. 

<strong>Research Interests</strong>: Conditional/temporal fact extraction from massive text corpora with minimal human effort. For example: Given text documents (news, papers), can we extract (entity, attribute, value)-tuples, called EAV-tuples, and their conditions (e.g., from when to when, under what temperature)?
