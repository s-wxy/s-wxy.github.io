Hello! I am a 2nd year Ph.D student in <a rel="mjiang" href="http://www.meng-jiang.com/">Dr.Meng Jiang</a>'s Data Mining towards Decision Making (DM2) Lab at CSE@Notre Dame. I am currently serving as professional development chair in Notre Dame grad-Society of Women Engineers. 

<strong>Research Interests</strong>: Text mining - Conditional/temporal fact extraction. 
For example: Given text documents (news, papers), can we extract (entity, attribute, value)-tuples, called EAV-tuples, and their conditions (e.g., from when to when, under what temperature)?
