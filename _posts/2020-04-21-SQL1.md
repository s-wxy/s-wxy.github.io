### Points ###
* LIMIT
* OFFSET
* IFNULL


### 176. Second Highest Salary ###

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the **Employee** table.

| Id | Salary |  
|----|--------|
| 1  |  100   |   
| 2  |  200   |
| 3  |  300   |


For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return **200** as
the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query
should return **null**.

| SecondHighestSalary |
|---------------------|
|       200           |

#### Solution ####
```SQL
SELECT
IFNULL(
(SELECT DISTINCT Salary
 FROM Employee
 ORDER BY Salary DESC
 LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
),null) AS SecondHighestSalary;
```
#### Points ####
* LIMIT
* OFFSET, specifies the number of rows to return
* IFNULL - remember edge case

### 177. Nth Highest Salary ###

Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.
For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200.
If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

#### Solution ####
```SQL
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    SET N = N-1;
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      SELECT DISTINCT Salary
			FROM Employee
			ORDER BY Salary DESC
		  LIMIT 1 OFFSET N
  );
END
```
