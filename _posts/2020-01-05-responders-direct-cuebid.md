What responder's direct cuebid means is a disputed yet underdiscussed topic.
There are two popular usage of this bid:

* Limit raise or better
* Generic game force

I suggest a combination of these.  Cuebid means limit raise __or__ generic game
force.  However, 3+-card support is still promised after a major opening.

After a major opening
---------------------
For pigeonhole principle, you have either of these:
* 3+-card support
* 5+-card unbid suit
* 4-4 in unbid suits
* 4+-card adverse suit

With game-forcing values yet without 3-card support, you can better describe
your hand by another call.
* 5+-card unbid suit: free bid
* 4-4 in unbid suits: negative double
* 4+-card adverse suit: 3NT

Therefore, it is safe to assume that the direct cuebid promises 3+-card
support, no matter of strength.

After a minor opening
---------------------
According to the previous section, even with game-forcing values, you can have
a embarrassing hand without 4-card support, a biddable side suit, nor a stopper
in the adverse suit.  For example, imagine holding the following hand at
1♣-(1♠)-?

♠ xxx  
<span class="redsuit">♥</span> Axx  
<span class="redsuit">♦</span> Axxx  
♣ Axx

You could have bid 3NT if RHO did not overcall, but you cannot now because
there is no spade stopper.  You don't want to pass because 3NT is still
playable if your partner has a spade stopper.  You _want_ to ask for stopper
with 2♠.

From the discussion above, we can conclude that generic game force is a better
agreement for cuebid.  Nevertheless, including limit raise in the cuebid does
not affect opener's rebidding structure, because they are eager to show a
stopper as notrump games are usually better than minor games.

As for 1<span class="redsuit">♦</span>-(2♣)-3♣, it is limit raise or better
because with invitational+ values:

* Free bid with at least 5 cards in a major
* Negative double with at least 4-3 in majors
* Notrump with a stopper or 4+ clubs

Therefore, you cuebid only when you have 4+ diamonds.

Conclusion
----------
I have shown that limit raise or generic game force is a reasonable agreement
for responder's direct cuebid.  Despite of the combination, 1m-(1M)-2M are the
only cases when responder cuebids without decent support but excessive values.
