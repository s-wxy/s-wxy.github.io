What responder's direct cuebid means is a disputed yet underdiscussed topic.
There are two popular usage of this bid:

* Limit raise or better
* Generic game force

After a major opening
---------------------
For pigeonhole principle, you have either of these:
* 3+-card support
* 5+-card unbid suit
* 4-4 in unbid suits
* 4+-card adverse suit


After a minor opening
---------------------
According to the previous section, even with game-forcing values, you can have
a embarrassing hand without 4-card support, a biddable side suit, nor a stopper
in the adverse suit.  For example, imagine holding the following hand at
1♣-(1♠)-?


Therefore, you cuebid only when you have 4+ diamonds.

Conclusion
----------
I have shown that limit raise or generic game force is a reasonable agreement
for responder's direct cuebid.  Despite of the combination, 1m-(1M)-2M are the
only cases when responder cuebids without decent support but excessive values.
